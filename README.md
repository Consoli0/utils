# Hi

This is a small assortment of a few utilities I'd like to use in other places, so I created a package for them.

_**Documentation hasn't been written yet, please either read the source code or check back later, thanks!**_

~~Check out the `docs` folder on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Consoli0/utils/tree/master/docs).~~
